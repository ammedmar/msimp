	We describe, using just a finite number of generating properadic maps, a natural $E_\infty$-algebra structure on the cochain complex of multisimplicial sets, a generalization of both simplicial and cubical sets.
	Additionally, given one such $X$, we construct explicit zig-zags of $E_\infty$-quasi-isomorphisms between its cochains and both; the singular cochains of its geometric realization $\bars{X}$, and the cochains of its diagonal simplicial set $X^\diag$.
	We then use these techniques to study certain constructions in the theory configuration spaces.
%	We construct explicit $E_\infty$-quasi-isomorphisms between their singular cochains and both; the McClure--Smith's and Barratt--Eccles models.
%	and both; the singular cochains on $\cong(r,d)$ as well as
