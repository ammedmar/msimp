	We construct a natural $E_\infty$-coalgebra structure on the chain complex of multisimplicial sets, a generalization of both simplicial and cubical sets.
	Additionally, given one such $X$, we describe an explicit zig-zag of $E_\infty$-quasi-isomorphisms between its chains and both; the singular chains of its geometric realization $\bars{X}$, and the chains of its diagonal simplicial set $X^\diag$.
	We then use these techniques to study the Surjection algebraic model of an euclidean configuration space interpreted as the chain complex of a multisimplicial set.
%	We construct explicit $E_\infty$-quasi-isomorphisms between their singular cochains and both; the McClure--Smith's and Barratt--Eccles models.
%	and both; the singular cochains on $\cong(r,d)$ as well as
