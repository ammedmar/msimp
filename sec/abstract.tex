	This paper presents a natural extension of previously defined $E_\infty$-coalgebra structures on the chains of simplicial and cubical sets to multisimplicial sets. We focus on the surjection chain complexes of McClure--Smith as a main examples, and construct a zig-zag of complexity-preserving quasi-isomorphisms of $E_\infty$-coalgebras relating these to both the singular chains on configuration spaces and the Barratt--Eccles chain complexes.
