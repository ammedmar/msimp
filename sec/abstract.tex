\begin{abstract}
	We construct an $E_\infty$-coalgebra structure on the chains of multisimplicial sets extending the previously defined $E_\infty$-coalgebra structures on simplicial and cubical chains.
	Additionally, we describe an explicit zig-zag of structure preserving quasi-isomorphisms between the chains of a multisimplicial set and both; the singular chains of its geometric realization, and the chains of its associated diagonal simplicial set.
	We then use these techniques to study the ``Surjection model'' of configuration spaces, which can be interpreted as having a multisimplicial origin.
