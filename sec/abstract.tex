\begin{abstract}
	We define an $E_\infty$-coalgebra structure on the chains of multisimplicial sets.
	Our primary focus is on the surjection chain complexes of McClure-Smith, for which we construct a zig-zag of complexity preserving quasi-isomorphisms of $E_\infty$-coalgebras relating them to both the singular chains on configuration spaces and the Barratt--Eccles chain complexes.
