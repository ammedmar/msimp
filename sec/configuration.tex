\section{Models of configuration spaces}

We are interested in modeling algebraically the $\sym_r$-equivariant homotopy type of the space of configurations of $r$ labeled and distinct points in Euclidean $d$-dimensional space.
Multisimplicial sets can be used to provide an explicit chain complex model with a small number of generators, which, using the $E_\infty$-structure defined in this paper, retains all homotopical information by Mandell's theorem \cite{mandell2006homotopy_type}.

In the first subsection, we recall a method due to Berger detecting spaces homotopy equivalent to euclidean configuration spaces by means of a filtration indexed by a {\em complete graph poset}.
In the second subsection, we construct the multisimplicial model and show that is equipped with such a filtration.
In the third subsection, we recall the construction of the simplicial Barratt-Eccles model and show that is equipped with a similar filtration.
In the fourth subsection, we relate the multisimplicial and simplicial chain models by an explicit map. In the last subsection, we give some examples of the sizes of the two models, showing that the multisimplicial is smaller.
