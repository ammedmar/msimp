\section{\pdfEinfty-models of configuration spaces}

We are interested in modeling algebraically the equivariant homotopy type of the configuration space of $r$ labeled points in Euclidean $d$-dimensional space.
Multisimplicial sets can be used to provide an explicit chain complex model with a small number of generators.
By Mandell's theorem \cite{mandell2006homotopy_type} and the $E_\infty$-structure introduced in \cref{ss:e-infty extension} this model retains all homotopical information.

In the first subsection we recall a method due to Berger detecting spaces homotopy equivalent to euclidean configuration spaces by means of a filtration indexed by a {\em complete graph poset}.    
In the second subsection we construct the multisimplicial model and show that is equipped with such a filtration.
In the third subsection we recall the construction of the simplicial Barratt-Eccles model and show that is  equipped with a similar filtration.
In the fourth subsection we relate the multisimplicial and simplicial chain models by an explicit map. In the last subsection we give some examples of sizes of the two models, showing that the multisimplicial is smaller.

\subsection{Counting generators}

Let us set $\chi_d(r):=\chains\sur_{d}(r)$. We stress that the number of generators in $\chi_d(r)$, corresponding to non-degenerate surjections, is much smaller than the corresponding number of generators in $\cE_d(r)$.
We give some examples.
Let us consider the generating polynomial functions counting the generators
$$PE_d^r(x) = \sum_i rank(\cE_d(r)_i) x^i $$ $$P\chi_d^r(x)=
\sum_i rank(\chi_d(r)_i) x^i$$
Then for example
\begin{align*}
	& PE_2^4(x)=24(1+23x+104x^2+196x^3+184x^4+86x^5+16x^6)\\
	& P\chi_2^4(x)=24(1+6x+10x^2+5x^3) \\
	& \\
	& PE_3^3(x) = 6(1+5x+25x^2+60x^3+70x^4+38x^5+8x^6 ) \\
	&  P\chi_3^3(x)= 6(1+3x+7x^2+9x^3+6x^4+x^5)
\end{align*}
Therefore the multisimplicial approach using $\chi$ is much more efficient than the simplicial
approach using $\cE$, when performing computations as in \cite{salvatore2020planarnonformality}.
