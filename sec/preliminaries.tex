\subsection{Cellular spaces}

TBW

\subsection{Chain complexes}

Throughout this article $\k$ denotes a commutative and unital ring and we work over its associated closed symmetric monoidal category of differential (homologically) graded $\k$-modules $(\Ch, \ot, \k)$.
We refer to the objects and morphisms of this category as \textit{chain complexes} and \textit{chain maps} respectively. We denote by $\Hom(C, C^\prime)$ the chain complex of $\k$-linear maps between chain complexes $C$ and $C^\prime$, and refer to the functor $\Hom(-, \k)$ as \textit{linear duality}.

\subsection{Category theory}

Given categories $\sB$ and $\sC$ we denote their associated \textit{functor category} by $\Fun(\sB, \sC)$.
%A category is said to be \textit{Cartesian} if is a monoidal category whose monoidal structure is given by the category-theoretic product and whose unit is a terminal object.
%A Cartesian category $(\mathsf{A}, \times, \mathbb{1})$ is equipped with natural diagonal and augmentation maps $\Delta_a \colon a \to a \times a$ and $\varepsilon_a \colon a \to \mathbb{1}$.
%
%\anibal{maybe this notion is not needed}
Recall that a category is said to be \textit{small} if its objects and morphisms form sets.
We denote the category of small categories by $\Cat$.
A category is said to be \textit{cocomplete} if any functor to it from a small category has a colimit.
If $\mathsf{A}$ is small and $\mathsf{C}$ cocomplete, then the (left) \textit{Kan extension of $g$ along $f$} exists for any pair of functors $f$ and $g$ in the diagram below, and it is the initial object in $\Fun(\sB, \mathsf{C})$ making
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=normal, row sep=normal]
\mathsf{A} \arrow[d, "f"'] \arrow[r, "g"] & \mathsf{C} \\
\sB \arrow[dashed, ur, bend right] & \quad
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
commute.
A Kan extension along the \textit{Yoneda embedding}, i.e., the functor
\[
\yoneda \colon \mathsf{A} \to \Fun(\mathsf{A}^\op, \Set)
\]
induced by the assignment
\[
a \mapsto \big( a^\prime \mapsto \mathsf{A}(a^\prime, a) \big),
\]
is referred to as a \textit{Yoneda extension}.
Objects in the image of the Yoneda embedding as are called \textit{representable}.
For any object $X$ of $\Fun(\mathsf{A}^\op, \Set)$ we have
\[
X \cong \colim_{\yoneda(a) \downarrow X} \yoneda(a)
\]
where ${\yoneda(a) \downarrow X}$ is the over-category of $X$ in $\Fun(\mathsf{A}^\op, \Set)$.

%\subsection{Simplicial sets}
%
%We denote the \textit{simplex category} by $\simplex$, the category of \textit{simplicial sets} by $\sSet = \Fun(\simplex^\op, \Set)$ and the \textit{standard $n$-simplex} by
%\[
%\simplex^n = \yoneda \big( [n] \big)
%\qquad \text{with} \qquad
%\simplex^n_m = \simplex^n \big( [m] \big).
%\]
%As usual, we denote an element in $\stspx{n}_m$ by a non-decreasing tuple $[v_0, \dots, v_m]$ with $v_i \in \{0, \dots, n\}$ with \textit{face} and \textit{degenerate maps} denoted by
%\begin{align*}
%\face_i [v_0, \dots, v_m] & = [v_0, \dots, \widehat v_i, \dots, v_m], \\
%\dege_i [v_0, \dots, v_m] & = [v_0, \dots, v_i, v_i, \dots, v_m].
%\end{align*}
%
%The \textit{Cartesian product} $X \times Y$ of simplicial sets is defined using the diagonal in small categories $\simplex \to \simplex \times \simplex$.
%It makes $\sSet$ into a symmetric monoidal category.
%
%\subsection{Simplicial chains}
%
%The functor of (normalized) \textit{chains}
%\[
%\chains \colon \sSet \to \Ch,
%\]
%is defined as the Yoneda extension of the functor defined on representable simplicial sets by
%\[
%\chains(\simplex^n)_m =
%\frac{\k\{\simplex^n_m\}}{\bigoplus \k\{\mathrm{img}(\dege_i)\}},
%\qquad
%\bd = \sum (-1)^i \face_i.
%\]
%We omit the superscript $\simplex$ from the notation $\chains$ if no confusion may result from doing so.
%
%The functor of \textit{simplicial cochains} is defined through linear duality.
%
%\subsection{EZ-AW contraction}
%
%The functor of chains is not monoidal in general, but there are natural transformations
%\[
%\begin{split}
%\EZ & \colon \chains(X_1) \ot \chains(X_2) \to \chains(X_1 \times X_2), \\
%\AW & \colon \chains(X_1 \times X_2) \to \chains(X_1) \ot \chains(X_2),
%\end{split}
%\]
%known respectively as \textit{Eilenberg--Zilber} and \textit{Alexander--Whitney maps}.
%These satisfy that $\EZ \circ \AW$ is the identity and that $\AW \circ \EZ$ is naturally chain homotopic to the identity.
%Furthermore, they forms of associativity that make the extensions to maps
%\[
%\begin{split}
%\EZ & \colon \chains(X_1) \ot \dotsb \ot \chains(X_k) \to \chains(X_1 \times \dotsb \times X_k), \\
%\AW & \colon \chains(X_1 \times \dotsb \times X_k) \to \chains(X_1) \ot \dotsb \ot \chains(X_k).
%\end{split}
%\]
%unambiguously defined.
%\begin{align*}
%\EZ \circ (\EZ \ot \, \id) &= \EZ \circ (\id \ot \EZ) \\
%(\AW \ot \, \id) \circ \AW &= (\id \ot \AW) \circ \AW
%\end{align*}
%For future reference we give an explicit description of these maps.

%\anibal{include the formulas}
%
%\subsection{Alexander--Whitney coalgebra} \label{ss:aw coalgebra}
%
%The \textit{Alexander--Whitney coalgebra} structure is defined by the following natural maps.
%For any $n \in \N$, define $\epsilon \colon \chains(\triangle^n) \to \k$ by
%\[
%\epsilon \big( [v_0, \dots, v_q] \big) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{ if } q = 0, \\ 0 & \text{ if } q>0, \end{cases}
%\]
%and $\Delta \colon \chains(\triangle^n) \to \chains(\triangle^n) \ot \chains(\triangle^n)$ by
%\[
%\chains(\simplex^n) \xra{\chains(\diag)} \chains(\simplex^n \times \simplex^n) \xra{\AW} \chains(\simplex^n) \ot \chains(\simplex^n)
%\]
%where $\diag$ is the diagonal in $\sSet$.
%Explicitly,
%\[
%\Delta \big( [v_0, \dots, v_q] \big) =
%\sum_{i=0}^q \, [v_0, \dots, v_i] \ot [v_i, \dots, v_q].
%\]
%
%The product induced on cochains is referred to as \textit{simplicial cup product}.
